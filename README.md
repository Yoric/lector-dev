# About OpenBerg Lector

[OpenBerg Lector](http://openberg.github.io/lector/) is an open-source, cross-platform e-Book reader written in HTML5. You may use it from any computer, without any installation.

For the moment, Lector supports only the epub format.

## A word of warning

This is *alpha software* (version 0.2 to be more precise). It should work, but expect bugs, imperfections and missing features. For instance, some books cannot be opened, or may not work properly.

Also, OpenBerg Lector has been developed and tested primarily for Firefox and Firefox OS. While the objective is to make it work with all modern browsers, we have not reached this stage.

## Feedback

At this stage, we need lots of feedback. Please use [the issue tracker](https://github.com/openberg/lector/issues) to report bugs or request features.

# Using OpenBerg Lector

Open [OpenBerg Lector](http://openberg.github.io/lector/), click/touch anywhere, pick a file. To change page, use either the keyboard (arrows) or the touchscreen.

## Additional notes for Firefox OS

Out of the box, Firefox OS does not provide an application for opening files. I recommend installing [Explorer](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/explorer) and/or [Finder](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/finder). Both applications will let you pick books that OpenBerg Lector can open.

## Additional notes for Android

Out of the box, Android does not provide an application for opening files. I recommend installing a file picker such as [SD File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop).

# What's next?

OpenBerg Lector is under heavy development. Expect many new features in upcoming versions.
